    "All this time we've been working with simple containers, but Podman received its name because it's also a pod manager. But, what are a pods? Pods are a group of one or more containers sharing the same network, pid and ipc namespaces. If two containers are in the same pod they can reach each other by using localhost or 127.0.0.1 adress.\n",
