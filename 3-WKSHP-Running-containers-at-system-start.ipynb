    "# Running containers at system start\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many situations in which you may want to start a container automatically when the system starts. A good example of this would be an edge environment, think of a small ruggered computer in a factory that runs containerized software using Podman. If there is a power failure the system will of course shut down, once the power is back the system will boot on and most likely you would like your containers to start automatically after boot. We can easily achieve this by taking advantage of systemd and Podman.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most linux distributions systemd is the parent of all processes on the system, it is executed by the kernel and is responsible for starting all other processes. If we want to automatically start a process, like a container, at system start it's a best practice to take advantage of systemd. Podman is capable of helping with this process, lets see how.\n",
