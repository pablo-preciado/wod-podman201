    "# Podman storage\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained through the Podman 101 workshop, once a container is deleted all the data stored in it is also deleted. This is a problem for certain applications that may require to persist data.\n",
    "Think of a containerized database, at some point you will update the database version, to achieve this you'll delete your old version container and deploy the new version container. In this example all the data stored in the database would be lost. Then, how can application data be preserved? Podman provides some different options for adding persistent storage and manage volumes, we are going to explore them throught this section of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Store Data on Host Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Podman provides mechanisms to use container host machine storage by using volumes and bind mounts. It provides the following benefits:\n",
    " - Data stored in the container host machine persists across container deletions.\n",
    " - As you're not using the Copy On Write (COW) filesystem within the container, it will usually provide better write performance.\n",
    " - Data can be shared between multiple containers. A typical examples is when one container is accessing to the volume for read/write operations while a second container is accessing only for reads.\n",
    " - It's possible to use external storage as you can host data mounts over the network, for examples by using NFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of managing storage: volumes and binds. Volumes are fully managed by Podman while binds are data mounts managed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with binds, first we need to create a directory in which we will store our data."
